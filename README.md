This repository will host the official implementation of our paper: "**End-to-end freeform lens design via self-supervised ray tracing neural network with integrated manufacturability**" (under review).
## Overview
Freeform surfaces enable unprecedented control over complex irradiance distributions, yet their inverse design remains computationally intensive and lacks generalizability across diverse target patterns. We introduce a self-supervised ray tracing neural network that unites a neural network backbone with differentiable ray tracing in an end-to-end learning framework. 

## **Code Release Coming Soon**
