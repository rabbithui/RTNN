# RTNN
This repository will host the official implementation of our paper: "**Processable Freeform Optical Lens Design Method Based on Differentiable Ray Tracing Neural Network**" (under review).
## Overview
Despite the exceptional light-field control capabilities of freeform surfaces, their inverse design based on source emission characteristics and desired beam distribution remains a challenging task, particularly in complex scenarios. We propose a novel self-supervised learning-based **ray tracing neural network (RTNN) for universal freeform surface design**.
